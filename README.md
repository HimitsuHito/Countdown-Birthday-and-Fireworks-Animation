# Countdown-Birthday-Fireworks-Animation
I made countdown birthday and fireworks animation using HTML Canvas, CSS, JS. The fireworks animation gonna come out once the countdown is finished or in other words, "Birthday Time". And you also can adjust the countdown time.  See the Demo in here : https://martarion-code.github.io/Countdown-Birthday-Fireworks-Animation/Birthday%20Countdown%20+%20Fireworks%20Animation/ or if you want to seeing it in Codepen, you can see it here : https://codepen.io/MahardikaBayu-Code/pen/MWmXLOo
